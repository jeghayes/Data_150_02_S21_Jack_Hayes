# Literature Review Outline
 
 
### Intro
Introduce geospatial data, specifically satellite-based emergency mapping and how it relates to environmental impact assessment

Flow into disaster management and how places like Japan find this data incredibly useful due to the high rates of earthquakes


### Body
Talk about japanâ€™s disaster management system (source 2)

Combine it with the small article about RS tech connecting it with geospatial data

Flow into research about how areas affected the most faced a lot of consequences with development and how the disaster management process can still be improved (Mention the environmental factors which bring about social development)


### Body
Give and example about social capital and relocation affecting development (source 3)

Relate the relocation and post-disaster organizations and plans to gender perspectives (Talk about how the geographical relocation is easier to predict thus leading to a better prediction of social capital)


### Body
Talk about source 4 and give detailed examples from the photovoice research project (Psychological factors are nearly impossible to predict, emergent property that does not necessarily link to an individual specific agent)

Start connecting the gender inequalities with human development and Amartya Sen

Dive into how this development process is a complex adaptive system

Start building back up to broader social development and disaster management


### Conclusion
Piece back together with my own ideas and arguments concerning gender perspectives and disaster management

The scientific question of how social development, specifically bettering gender perspectives, leads to a better disaster management response and plan

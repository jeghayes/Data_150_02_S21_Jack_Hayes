This excerpt explores some of the struggles Japan has faced with social freedoms, specifically gender-related issues, after natural disasters. Following disasters such as the Kobe Earthquake and Great East Japan Earthquake, gender perspectives were not just overlooked, but reinforced in Japanese society. Saito mainly looks at geospatial data relating to the disaster prevention and evacuation management of Japan. He dives into the great contributions of neighborhood disaster prevention organisations and other association leaders’ roles in disaster management. 

During the period of high-economic growth in Japan, men were seen as the breadwinners of their family, having to work far from home. This made women responsible for domestic work. After the Kobe Earthquake, it was evident that the gender roles were hurting the social development of Japan. Community disaster management organisations are a big part of disaster prevention in Japan and after the Kobe Earthquake, it was revealed that 96% of the leaders in these resident associations were men. Women, on the other hand, were mainly involved in very small organisations, like the household fire prevention club. Additionally, after the emergency phase following the Great East Japan Earthquake, various gender-related issues arose. Women voluntarily cooked at evacuation sites while men were paid to do jobs like moving debris, for example. The mortality rate of women in Japan is noticeably higher than that of men because of these gender perspectives. Single and older women often live in less secure and safe places because of the few economic opportunities women have in Japan, due to their unreasonable low employment rate and social status. Saito understands that these social unfreedoms are greatly hurting the development of Japan in multiple ways and elaborates on possible solutions. When the author speaks of ways to solve these gender perspectives, the reader can tell that Saito holds similar views to Amartya Sen on the development. Saito believes that the main ways to conquer these gender-related issues is through building a resilient community and educating the public of these social issues. The ideas the author presents are within Condorcet’s beliefs of reasoned freedom.

The author’s goal is to plan Japan’s future for combating natural disasters along with fighting gender-related issues as well. Relating strictly to disaster prevention, Saito stresses that the use of temporary shelters are just as important as spending time to prevent the disaster in the first place. The author also proposes two major ways to combat the gender inequalities and inequities in Japan not just for future disasters, but for the present state of Japanese society as well. Although slower, long-term approaches, Saito expresses a need for more research and public education relating to gender roles, along with a building of resilient, better informed communities.

The article “Disaster Management in Japan” by Toshinori Ogata encompasses a broader look at the processes and data behind Japan’s disaster management. One can relate the protective security freedoms presented in the writing to human development. The author goes in depth about Japan’s use of geospatial data regarding earthquakes in specific regions and how said data can be used to predict damages and help outline countermeasures against such disasters. The fascinating and methodical actions of Japan’s disaster response management is a model of what disaster response methods should look like in terms of efficiency. 

Ogata breaks down Japan’s three-tiered administration system consisting of the national government, prefectures, and municipalities. In the event or risk of disaster, the cabinet office takes the lead in countermeasures and assesses the danger of disaster in a one to five scale. The Extreme Disaster Management Headquarters (EDMH) is led by the Prime Minister and is responsible for accurate and prompt emergency response. The author then dives into geospatial earthquake data from the Nankai Trough Earthquake, Tokyo Inland Earthquake, and the Great East Japan Earthquake. After learning from the data provided from these earthquakes, the EDMH can now immediately grasp the whole picture of the damage and action of a disaster. Ogata then segways into the advancement of The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. The ministry has three pillars on how to efficiently and effectively provide health care in the event of a disaster: setting up disaster base hospitals, operating and training Disaster Medical Assistance Teams, and establishing an Emergency Medical Information system. Ogata brought about the scientific question of how to advance disaster management through data. He presented that the disasters of Japan’s past had detrimental effects on Japan socially and economically. He then displayed how the use of geospatial data created a spark in improving the disaster management problem and showed the reader how the development of protective security through this data greatly benefitted the safety, economy, and some social aspects of Japan.

Although this article doesn’t directly point out the relationship of these processes and human development, the reader can draw clear comparisons between the growth of disaster response in Japan and Amartya Sen’s definition of human development. The slow development of a better understanding of disaster response through protective security is a great picture for Sen’s belief in a slow, broad growth in societal development due to public health advancements and learning from data.

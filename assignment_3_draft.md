## Intro draft
Gender inequalities and inequities have been affecting the world seemingly since the beginning of time. Especially with a recent surge in social justice, the battle against gender perspectives around the globe has gained more and more attention. However, countries like Japan are still struggling to combat gender perspectives. One of the main sources of these gender-related issues in Japan is not as apparent as one would think, however. Data concerning the reinforcement of gender perspectives can be seen in almost every natural disaster in Japan’s recent history. Analyzing this data through certain geospatial data methodologies such as surveys and satellite-based mapping systems is incredibly important for catalyzing a response to fight these injustices. Women have a significantly higher mortality rate than men in Japan and have to constantly voice their grievances about being unheard in their communities. This problem is extremely prevalent during the almost never-ending process of reconstruction. For example, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred in 2011 and the social discord caused by the earthquake is still felt today, as Japan is still under reconstruction. The social cohesion of a population leads to a better educated, economically flourishing, happy society, but social cohesion cannot be achieved without the recognition and solving of gender inequalities and inequities. 

The lack of administrative participation is an inherent problem in the fight against these Japanese social issues. Whether it’s informing the public of said gender perspectives, or involving organizations like gender equality centers in disaster management systems, the high-ranking individuals within Japan’s government have a big role in this process. What policies and ideas can Japan’s authorities implement within their disaster management systems to combat gender inequalities and improve community resilience as a whole?
